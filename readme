Notes:

* This is Maven project. execute MVN
* The server only support GET requests and supports Keep-Alive with a 15sec Timeout.
* Dependency => Apache HttpComponent for the request/response implementation (mostly to avoid re-implementing http header parsing).
* Dependency => Guice for dependency injection
*
* Be kind, I have not written any code for the last 4 years :-)
